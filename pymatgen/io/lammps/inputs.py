class LammpsInputFile(InputFile):
    """
    Class representing a LAMMPS input settings file, e.g. in.lammps.
    Allows for LAMMPS input generation in line/stage wise manner. A stage
    here is defined as a block of LAMMPS input commands usually performing a
    specific task during the simulation such as energy minimization or
    NPT/NVT runs. But more broadly, a stage can also be a block of LAMMPS
    input where the simulation box is set up, a set of variables are declared or
    quantities are computed.

    The LammpsInputFile is defined by the attribute `list_of_commands`,
    i.e. a list of stages (strings) together with the corresponding LAMMPS input settings (strings).
    The structure is the following:
    ```
    list_of_commands = [
        ["Stage 1", [[cmd1, args1], [cmd2, args2]]],
        ["Stage 2", [[cmd3, args3]]]
    ]
    ```
    where cmd's are the LAMMPS command names (e.g., "units", or "pair_coeff")
    and the args are the corresponding arguments.
    "Stage 1" and "Stage 2" are examples of stage names.
